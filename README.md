# Express Starter

This starter repo will be used for building applications using React, Material-UI, React-Router, Node, & Express.js.

## Getting started

The project is broken down into a client and server folder.

### Quick Start

start the backed server first, as it is referenced as a proxy on the front end.

```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

in a new window, start the front end

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

you should then be able to access the page at the provided link referenced by the server (most liklely http://localhost:3000/)
